# notify.js
A simple fa√ßade library to the Web Notifications API (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/).

## Browser support
Currently, only Google Chrome implements the API, through
    window.webkitNotifications
as other browsers implement it too, I'll try to add them as adapters.
