# notify.js
A simple fa√ßade library to the Web Notifications API (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/).

## Browser support
Currently, only Google Chrome implements the API, through
    window.webkitNotifications
as other browsers implement it too, I'll try to add them as adapters.

## License
This library is released under modified BSD License. See BSD-LICENSE.txt.
Additionaly, some Phoenity Aura icons were added to this project, but they're not required. I haven't been
able to enter the author's website, so I'll update the icons licensing info when the site is back again.
